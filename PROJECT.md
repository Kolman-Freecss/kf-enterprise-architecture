# Intelligent Document Processing System

## What This Project Is

A **production-ready enterprise AI system** that demonstrates how to properly architect, implement, and deploy Generative AI solutions in real business environments. Built around document processing as a common enterprise use case.

## Core Problem Solved

Organizations process thousands of documents daily (contracts, invoices, reports, emails) but struggle to:
- Extract structured insights from unstructured data
- Scale AI processing while maintaining security and compliance
- Integrate AI capabilities with existing enterprise systems
- Monitor and govern AI usage effectively

## What You Get

### **Live System Components**
- **Document Upload & Processing**: Multi-format support (PDF, DOCX, images)
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Classification, extraction, sentiment analysis, entity recognition
- **Semantic Search**: Vector-based similarity search across document collections
- **Compliance Checking**: PII detection, regulatory compliance validation
- **RESTful API**: Production-ready endpoints with authentication and rate limiting

### **Enterprise Architecture Patterns**
- **Multi-layer Design**: Clear separation of concerns across 6 architectural layers
- **Agentic Systems**: MCP (Model Context Protocol) based agent communication
- **Event-Driven Processing**: Asynchronous workflows with proper error handling
- **Security-First**: Zero-trust architecture with end-to-end encryption
- **Cloud-Native**: AWS services integration with auto-scaling and monitoring

### **AI/ML Integration**
- **AWS Bedrock**: Foundation model access with provider abstraction
- **SageMaker**: Custom model endpoints for specialized tasks
- **Vector Databases**: Pinecone/ChromaDB for semantic search
- **Model Orchestration**: Intelligent routing and fallback mechanisms
