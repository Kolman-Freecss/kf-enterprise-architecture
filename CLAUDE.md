# GenAI Enterprise Architecture - Best Practices Guide

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates enterprise-grade Generative AI architecture through an **Intelligent Document Processing System**. It showcases real-world patterns for AI adoption, integration strategies, and responsible deployment practices.

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Multi-Layer Design Pattern
- **Presentation Layer**: Web interface and API endpoints
- **Orchestration Layer**: Workflow management and agent coordination
- **AI Services Layer**: Model inference and processing
- **Data Layer**: Vector stores, traditional databases, and file storage
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Cloud services and monitoring

### 2. Model Abstraction Strategy
- Use provider-agnostic interfaces for model switching
- Implement fallback mechanisms for service resilience
- Cache responses for cost optimization and performance

### 3. Agentic Architecture with MCP
- Standardized agent communication protocols
- Modular, extensible agent design
- Clear responsibility boundaries

## Development Commands

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Setup AWS credentials
aws configure

# Initialize vector database
npm run db:setup

# Start development environment
npm run dev
```

### Testing & Quality
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Type checking
npm run typecheck

# Linting
npm run lint

# Security audit
npm run audit

# Integration tests
npm run test:integration
```

### Deployment
```bash
# Build production
npm run build

# Deploy to staging
npm run deploy:staging

# Deploy to production
npm run deploy:prod

# Infrastructure as Code
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

## Enterprise Integration Patterns

### 1. API Gateway Pattern
- Centralized authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Request/response transformation
- Monitoring and logging

### 2. Event-Driven Architecture
- Asynchronous document processing
- Event sourcing for audit trails
- Dead letter queues for error handling

### 3. Circuit Breaker Pattern
- Prevent cascade failures
- Graceful degradation
- Automatic recovery

## Security & Governance

### Data Protection
- End-to-end encryption
- PII detection and masking
- Data retention policies
- Access control and auditing

### AI Ethics & Bias
- Bias detection in model outputs
- Fairness metrics and monitoring
- Human-in-the-loop validation
- Explainability requirements

### Compliance Framework
- SOC 2 Type II compliance
- GDPR data handling
- Industry-specific regulations
- Regular security assessments

## Performance Optimization

### Cost Management
- Model usage monitoring
- Intelligent caching strategies
- Resource allocation optimization
- Cost alerting and budgeting

### Scalability Patterns
- Horizontal scaling for processing
- Load balancing strategies
- Auto-scaling policies
- Performance monitoring

## Monitoring & Observability

### Key Metrics
- Model latency and throughput
- Accuracy and quality metrics
- System availability and errors
- Cost per transaction

### Alerting Strategy
- Service level objectives (SLOs)
- Error rate thresholds
- Performance degradation alerts
- Security incident detection

## Team Collaboration

### Code Standards
- TypeScript strict mode
- ESLint configuration
- Prettier formatting
- Husky pre-commit hooks

### Documentation
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- API documentation with OpenAPI
- Runbook for operations
- Troubleshooting guides
