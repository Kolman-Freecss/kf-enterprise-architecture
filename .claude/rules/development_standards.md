# Development Standards and Rules

## Code Quality Standards

### TypeScript Configuration
- Strict mode enabled (`strict: true`)
- No any types allowed without explicit reasoning
- Proper interface definitions for all data structures
- Comprehensive JSDoc documentation for public APIs

### Error Handling
- Never catch and ignore errors
- Use proper error types (custom error classes)
- Log errors with sufficient context
- Implement circuit breaker patterns for external services

### Security Requirements
- No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- Input validation for all external data
- Output sanitization to prevent injection attacks
- Proper encryption for data at rest and in transit

## Architecture Constraints

### API Design
- RESTful principles with proper HTTP status codes
- OpenAPI/Swagger documentation required
- Versioning strategy (v1, v2) for breaking changes
- Rate limiting and throttling implemented

### Database Access
- No direct database queries in business logic
- Use repository pattern for data access
- Proper connection pooling and timeout handling
- Database migrations with rollback capability

### AI/ML Integration
- Model responses must be validated and sanitized
- Implement fallback mechanisms for model failures
- Token usage tracking and cost monitoring
- A/B testing framework for model comparison

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Testing
- Minimum 80% code coverage
- Test all error conditions and edge cases
- Mock external dependencies
- Use descriptive test names and arrange-act-assert pattern

### Integration Testing
- End-to-end workflow validation
- External service integration tests
- Database integration with test fixtures
- Performance testing under load

### Security Testing
- Static code analysis (SAST) in CI pipeline
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Dynamic security testing for APIs
- Regular penetration testing

## Deployment Standards

### Infrastructure
- All infrastructure defined as code (Terraform)
- Immutable infrastructure patterns
- Blue-green deployment strategy
- Automated rollback on failure

### Monitoring
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Metrics collection for all critical paths
- Alerting on SLO violations
- Distributed tracing for request flows

### Documentation
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for major decisions
- Runbooks for operational procedures
- API documentation with examples
- Onboarding documentation for new team members

## Compliance and Governance

### Data Handling
- GDPR compliance for EU data subjects
- Data classification and retention policies
- PII detection and masking capabilities
- Audit trails for all data access

### AI Ethics
- Bias detection and mitigation strategies
- Explainable AI for critical decisions
- Human oversight for high-risk operations
- Regular model fairness assessments
