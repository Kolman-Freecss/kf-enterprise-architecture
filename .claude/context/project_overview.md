# Intelligent Document Processing System - Project Context

## Project Mission
Build an enterprise-grade Generative AI system that demonstrates real-world patterns for document processing, analysis, and knowledge extraction.

## Business Case
Organizations process thousands of documents daily (contracts, invoices, reports, emails) that contain valuable insights locked in unstructured data. This system showcases how to:
- Extract structured data from various document types
- Enable semantic search across document collections
- Provide intelligent summarization and analysis
- Maintain enterprise security and compliance standards

## System Capabilities

### Document Processing Pipeline
1. **Ingestion**: Multi-format support (PDF, DOCX, images, emails)
2. **Classification**: Automatic document type identification
3. **Extraction**: Text, tables, images, metadata extraction
4. **Enrichment**: Entity recognition, sentiment analysis, key phrase extraction
5. **Storage**: Vector embeddings and structured data persistence

### AI-Powered Features
- **Intelligent Search**: Semantic similarity across document corpus
- **Summarization**: Executive summaries and key insights
- **Q&A System**: Natural language queries against document knowledge base
- **Compliance Checking**: Automated policy and regulation compliance
- **Trend Analysis**: Pattern recognition across document collections

## Architecture Goals

### Technical Excellence
- Microservices architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Event-driven processing for scalability and resilience
- API-first design for integration flexibility
- Comprehensive testing and quality assurance

### Enterprise Integration
- Single sign-on (SSO) integration
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Audit logging and compliance reporting
- Integration with existing document management systems

### Operational Excellence
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform
- CI/CD pipelines with automated testing
- Monitoring and alerting with SLO tracking
- Cost optimization and resource management

## Success Metrics
- **Performance**: <2s response time for document queries
- **Accuracy**: >95% accuracy for document classification
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime SLA
- **Security**: Zero security incidents, SOC 2 compliance
- **Cost**: <$0.10 per document processed
